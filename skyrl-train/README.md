# Overview

 With a focus on modularity, `skyrl-train` makes it easy to prototype new training algorithms, environments, and execution plans—without compromising usability or speed. 

`skyrl-train` is **for users who want to modify anything:**

- **Quickly develop new environments** without modifying or understanding the training code .
- **Modify the training execution plan** such as model placement, colocation or disaggregation of training and generation, and async RL.
- **Implement custom trajectory generation** specific to your use-case, such as custom sampling methods, tree search, etc.
- … make any other flexible modifications to the RL workflow!


## Key Features
The `skyrl-train` package supports:
- PPO and GRPO
- Training Backends: FSDP, FSDP2, and DeepSpeed
- Inference backends: vLLM, SGLang, and any custom OpenAI API compatible endpoint that exposes a method to perform weight sync
- Ulysses sequence parallelism for long-context training
- Colocated or disaggregated training and generation (including on heterogeneous hardware)
- Synchronous RL or async one-off pipelining
- Simple batched rollouts or Asynchronous rollouts for multi-turn conversations
- Weight sync via NCCL, gloo, or checkpoint-and-load
- Integration with `skyrl-gym` to run any environment in the gynasium
- Sequence packing and Flash Attention 2

## Documentation

Find `skyrl-train` documentation at: [skyrl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/](https://skyrl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

## Quick Start

A quick start guide for installation and your first training run is provided below.

### Requirements

The only requirements are:

- CUDA version >=12.4
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)

If you're running on an existing Ray cluster, make sure to use Ray 2.44.0 and Python 3.12. If not, proceed with the installation instructions below.


First, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/NovaSky-AI/SkyRL
cd SkyRL/skyrl-train
```

Then, create a new virtual environment and install the dependencies:

```bash
# creates a venv at .venv/
uv sync --extra vllm 
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Then, prepare the dataset:

```bash
uv run -- python examples/gsm8k/gsm8k_dataset.py
```

Finally, before training, make sure to configure Ray to use `uv`:

```bash
export RAY_RUNTIME_ENV_HOOK=ray._private.runtime_env.uv_runtime_env_hook.hook
# or add to your .bashrc
# echo 'export RAY_RUNTIME_ENV_HOOK=ray._private.runtime_env.uv_runtime_env_hook.hook' >> ~/.bashrc
```

You should now be able to run our example script (assumes at least 4 GPUs):

```bash
export WANDB_API_KEY=<your wandb api key>
bash examples/gsm8k/run_gsm8k.sh
```

For detailed installation instructions, as well as more examples, please refer to our [documentation](https://skyrl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Reproducing SkyRL-SQL
We also test SkyRL by reproducing our prior release [SkyRL-SQL](https://novasky-ai.notion.site/skyrl-sql), which enabled efficient Multi-Turn RL for Text2SQL. 
You can find a link to the wandb report [here](https://wandb.ai/sky-posttraining-uc-berkeley/skyrl-sql/reports/SkyRL-SQL---VmlldzoxMzM0MTAyMw), and a detailed walk through of the reproduction in our [documentation](https://skyrl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/multi_turn_text2sql.html).
